  Scenario: Valid file – all checks are successful
    Given I have a DATA file named "scenarios/aus-capitals.csv"
    And I have a TAG file named "scenarios/aus-capitals.tag"
    And I have a SCHEMA file named "scenarios/aus-capitals.json"
    When I execute the application with output "output/sbe-1-1.csv"
    Then the program should exit with RETURN CODE of "0"
